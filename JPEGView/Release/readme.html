					<h1>JPEGView Readme</h1>
					Revision: 04-July-2010
					<a name="Introduction"></a>
					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					JPEGView is a viewer/editor for JPEG, BMP, PNG, GIF and TIFF images. It is designed to view images from digital cameras
					full screen and with highest quality possible. Basic image editing functionality is provided - allowing to correct typical
					problems as color cast, high/low contrast and under- or overexposure very quickly and interactively during review of the
					images. JPEGView does not replace a full blown image editor - such an editor will just be needed less often.<br/>

					<a name="Installation"></a>
					<h2>Installation</h2>
					There is no installer for JPEGView because none is needed. Just copy or extract all files to a folder
					on your harddisk (e.g. C:\Program Files\JPEGView\).<br/>
					To define JPEGView as your default viewer for JPEG files, perform the following steps:
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>In the Windows Explorer, right click a file with extension .JPG</li>
						<li>On the context menu, choose 'Open with' - 'Choose program'</li>
						<li>
							On the dialog that is appearing, press the 'Browse' button, locate and double click the executable
							of JPEGView (JPEGView.exe)
						</li>
						<li>Select the 'Always open with...' option and confirm with OK</li>
						<li>If you have JPEG files with extension '.JPEG' repeat the procedure on a .JPEG file</li>
						<li>Repeat this procedure for the other image types that shall be opened with JPEGView</li>
					</ul>
					<b>Hardware Requirements</b><br/>
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>
							256 MB RAM<br/>
							512 MB RAM is required if images with more than 10 MegaPixels are viewed,
							less is acceptable if only small images (less than 5 MegaPixels) are viewed.
						</li>
						<li>
							CPU should be SSE2 capable (perfect is a CPU with 128 bit SSE2 processing and multiple CPU cores)<br/>
							Other CPUs also work but performance decreases somewhat
						</li>
						<li>A mouse with a scroll wheel (for zooming) and navigation buttons on the side is highly recommended</li>
					</ul>
					<b>Supported Systems</b><br/>
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>Windows 7</li>
						<li>Windows Vista</li>
						<li>Windows XP</li>
						<li>Windows 2000 : Needs gdiplus.dll in EXE folder (not part of distribution)</li>
					</ul>
					<b>Supported Languages</b><br/>
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>English</li>
						<li>German</li>
						<li>Spanish</li>
						<li>Italian</li>
						<li>French</li>
						<li>Korean</li>
					</ul>
					By default JPEGView uses the same language as the operating system. However another language can be forced using the INI file.
					Translations to other languages can be done very easily by providing an UTF8 coded text mapping file, see
					<a href="./strings_de.txt">strings_de.txt</a> as an example.<br/>
					If you want that your translation is included into the next JPEGView release, contact me at
					<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jpegview/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/jpegview/</a><br/>
					<b>Registry</b><br/>
					JPEGView does not touch the registry. Using the Windows Explorer for registering file types to be displayed with
					JPEGView will add some registry entries in the 'Current User' branch of the registry.<br/>
					<b>Created Files during Runtime</b><br/>
					The only location where files are written (the parameter DB and the user INI file)
					is in 'Documents and Settings\<i>Username</i>\Application Data\JPEGView\' (exception of this rule: see next section)<br/>
					Note that these files are only created when they are needed, e.g. when the first parameter set is stored to the parameter DB.<br/>
					<b>Forcing user data storage in EXE path</b><br/>
					By setting StoreToEXEPath=true in the global INI file,
					the storage location for the user INI file and the parameter DB can be changed to the EXE path of JPEGView. This makes
					sense when using JPEGView from an USB memory stick to prevent storing data on the host system.<br/>
					<b>Restricted Rights</b><br/>
					JPEGView runs without problems on accounts with restricted rights.

					<h2>Using JPEGView</h2>
					<a name="GettingStarted"></a>
					<h3>Getting started</h3>
					For getting started, the following commands in JPEGView are the most important ones:<br/>
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>
							<kbd>F1</kbd> displays help on JPEGView
						</li>
						<li>
							<kbd>F2</kbd> displays information about the current image
						</li>
						<li>
							<kbd>PgDn/PgUp</kbd> navigates to next/previous image (Alternative: 'forward' and 'back' mouse buttons)
						</li>
						<li>Mouse wheel zooms in and out</li>
						<li>Dragging mouse while left mouse button is pressed pans image</li>
						<li>Move mouse pointer to bottom of screen for image processing, parameter DB access and file renaming</li>
						<li>Move mouse pointer to top of screen for minimizing or closing the application</li>
						<li>Right mouse button displays the context menu</li>
						<li>
							<kbd>ESC</kbd> terminates the application
						</li>
					</ul>
					<a name="NavPanel"></a>
					<h3>Navigation panel</h3>
					<img src="Navpanel.png" alt="Navigation panel" border="0"/>
					<br/>
					From left to right:<br/>
					First image in folder, Previous image, Next image, Last image in folder<br/>
					Actual image size / Fit image to screen<br/>
					Window mode / Full screen mode<br/>
					Rotate clockwise, Rotate counter-clockwise<br/>
					Toggle landscape picture enhancement mode<br/>
					Toggle display of image information (EXIF)<br/>

					<h4>Full screen mode / Window mode</h4>
					By default JPEGView starts in full screen mode on the largest monitor attached to the computer.
					A window mode is also supported. Toggling between full screen and window mode is done with <kbd>Ctrl-W</kbd> or with
					the button on the navigation panel.<br/>
					By changing the INI file, it is possible to force JPEGView to start in window mode and to use a different monitor
					respectively window position and size. Note that when changing the window size with the mouse, the image is not
					scaled automatically to fit the new size. Press then <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to fit the image to the window.

					<a name="Viewing"></a>
					<h3>Viewing Images</h3>
					<h4>Navigation</h4>
					To navigate between images, the following commands are supported:
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>
							Next image<br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>PgDn or 'Left arrow'</kbd><br/>
							Mouse: 'Forward' mouse button (normally on left side of mouse)
						</li>
						<li>
							Previous image<br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>PgUp or 'Right arrow'</kbd><br/>
							Mouse: 'Back' mouse button
						</li>
						<li>
							First image in folder (according to sort order, see below)<br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>Home</kbd>
						</li>
						<li>
							Last image in folder (according to sort order, see below)<br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>End</kbd>
						</li>
						<li>
							Mark image for toggling<br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>Ctrl-M</kbd>
						</li>
						<li>
							Toggle between current image and marked image<br/>
							Note that toggling only works between images in the same folder<br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>Ctrl-Left arrow</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl-Right arrow</kbd>
						</li>
						<li>
							Reload image<br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>Ctrl-R</kbd><br/>
						</li>
						<li>
							Open image or folder<br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>Ctrl-O</kbd><br/>
							The standard 'File Open' dialog is shown and allows displaying images from other folders.
							Alternatively, a text file containing file names for a <a href="#SlideShow">slide show</a> can be opened.
						</li>
						<li>
							Drag and drop image or folder from Windows Explorer to JPEGView window.
						</li>
					</ul>
					The basic navigation command (First image in folder, Previous image, Next image, Last image in folder) are also
					available on the navigation panel, transparently blended over the image.<br/>
					JPEGView uses a second thread to read ahead and process the next image. Guessing the next image is based on
					the last navigations.<br/><br/>

					JPEGView supports the following navigation modes:
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>
							<kbd>F7</kbd>: (Default) Display all files in current folder, wrap around to first image when finished<br/>
							The file name of the current file and it's position in the folder can be displayed using <kbd>Ctrl-F2</kbd>.
						</li>
						<li>
							<kbd>F8</kbd>: Display all files in current folder, when finished recursively display images in subfolders.<br/>
							Subfolders in the same root directory are traversed in alphabetic order.
						</li>
						<li>
							<kbd>F9</kbd>: Display all files in current folder, when finished advance to next sibling folder
							(folder on same level as current folder)
						</li>
					</ul>
					<a name="DisplayOrder"></a>
					The default navigation mode can be changed in the <a href="#INIFile">INI file</a>.<br/><br/>
					The display-order within one folder is also configurable:
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>
							<kbd>m</kbd>: (Default) Order files according to date/time of last modification
						</li>
						<li>
							<kbd>c</kbd>: Order files according to date/time of creation
						</li>
						<li>
							<kbd>n</kbd>: Order files according to file name
						</li>
					</ul>
					The default ordering can be changed in the  <a href="#INIFile">INI file</a>.<br/>
					<h4>Image Information</h4>
					<h5>Image and EXIF information</h5>
					Use <kbd>F2</kbd> to display information about the current image, including the value of some EXIF tags, e.g. date and
					time the image was taken and exposure information.
					<h5>File name and path</h5>
					Use <kbd>Ctrl-F2</kbd> to display the full path and file name of the current image.
					<h4>Zoom and Pan</h4>
					Images can be zoomed and panned interactively. While zooming, a lower quality image processing mode is used. The
					image will be processed automatically with the high quality resize filters as soon as no zoom command is received for
					about half a second.<br/>
					By default, images that are larger than the screen are scaled down to fit the screen. Images that are smaller than the screen
					are not scaled by default. Use the following commands to change the zoom factor:
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>
							Fit image to screen<br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>Enter</kbd>
						</li>
						<li>
							Fill screen with crop (no black borders)<br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>Ctrl-Enter</kbd>
						</li>
						<li>
							Zoom to 100 % (One image pixel corresponds to one screen pixel)<br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>Space</kbd><br/>
							Toggles back to 'Fit to screen' when zoom is already 100 %<br/>
							Note that the point under the mouse cursor remains fixed during zoom - allows zooming to point of interest
						</li>
						<li>
							Enlarge view to span all monitors (only available on multi monitor systems)<br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>F12</kbd><br/>
							Panoramas look great in this mode if you have multiple screen.<br/>
							Pressing <kbd>F12</kbd> again toggles back to normal one-screen mode.
						</li>
						<li>
							Free Zoom<br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>'Plus' or Ctrl-'Arrow up'</kbd> to zoom in, <kbd>'Minus' or Ctrl-'Arrow down'</kbd> to zoom out<br/>
							Mouse: Mouse wheel
						</li>
						<li>
							Pan<br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>Shift+'Arrows'</kbd><br/>
							Mouse: Left mouse and drag<br/>
							Pan is only supported when the image is larger than the screen
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br/>Because almost all images from digital cameras must be sampled down for a typical monitor, the downsampling filter
					has been choosen carefully to provide an optimal image quality. The downsampling filter uses a 7 x 7 to 15 x 15
					(depending on resize-factor) Lanczos-like filter kernel. This kernel produces only a small amout of aliasing while
					preserving or even slightly enhancing the sharpness of the image. You can see the difference to simple point sampling when
					pressing <kbd>F3</kbd> what toggles between point sampling and filter based sampling.
					<h4>Auto Scale Mode</h4>
					The auto scale mode determines how images are fitted to the screen. The default auto scale mode is read from the
					INI file, however the mode can also be changed during runtime with the context menu, submenu 'Auto scale mode'.<br/>
					The following modes are supported:
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>
							Fit to screen (no zoom)<br/>
							Images that are larger than the screen are scaled down to fit. No image areas are cropped but black borders
							will be visible when the image aspect ratio and the screen aspect ratio do not match. Images that are smaller
							than the screen are not enlarged.
						</li>
						<li>
							Fill with crop (no zoom)<br/>
							Images that are larger than the screen are scaled down to fill the entire screen. Cropping occurs if necessary to
							avoid black borders. Images that are smaller than the screen are not enlarged.<br/>
							This mode is suited for viewing 4:3 images on a 16:9 wide screen without black borders.<br/>
							Note: Cropping is limited to approximately 30 % of the image in this mode. If more would be cropped, fit to screen is used instead.
							As a result, portrait images will not be cropped on the screen.
						</li>
						<li>
							Fit to screen<br/>
							Images are scaled (up or down) to fit the screen. No image areas are cropped but black borders can be visible.
						</li>
						<li>
							Fill with crop<br/>
							Images are scaled (up or down) to fill the entire screen. Unlimited cropping may occurs if necessary to avoid
							black borders.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Rotate</h4>
					With the <kbd>'Arrow down'</kbd> and <kbd>'Arrow up'</kbd> keys, the current image can be rotated clockwise, respectively
					counter-clockwise. Note that JPEGView looks for the rotation tag in the EXIF data to rotate the image automatically. Some
					cameras have an orientation sensor and set this tag.<br/>
					To rotate a JPEG image lossless on disk, use the <kbd>R</kbd> and <kbd>T</kbd> keys.
					<h4>Crop</h4>
					When the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key and the left mouse button are pressed and the mouse is dragged, a selection on the image can be
					defined. After having defined a selection, a context menu provides the following commands:
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>
							Crop image selection<br/>
							Crops the image selection and re-applies all image processing with the current parameters to the cropped image.
							When the color and contrast correction is active, the cropped image may looks different afterwards. Note that a crop
							operation cannot be stored to the parameter DB.
						</li>
						<li>
							Copy image selection to clipboard<br/>
							Note that this command will copy the image selection in original resolution and not in screen resolution.
						</li>
						<li>
							Crop Mode<br/>
							Sets the crop mode - either to free croping, fixed size cropping or cropping with a fixed aspect ratio.
							Note that the default fixed crop size can be set in the INI file.
						</li>
						<li>Zoom to selection</li>
					</ul>
					Hint: Use a large zoom factor and the point-sampling mode (F3 key) to crop with pixel precision.
					<br/><br/><b>
						<a href="#Top">Top of Page</a>
					</b><br/>

					<a name="SlideShow"></a>
					<h3>Slide Shows</h3>
					A text file containing file names can be passed on the command line to JPEGView. Alternatively such a file can be loaded
					using the 'Open image' command. The following text file formats are supported:
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>ANSI coded text file</li>
						<li>Unicode (UTF16) text file</li>
						<li>UTF8 coded text file</li>
					</ul>
					All text formats must contain one file name per line. The file names must use paths relative to the folder of the slide show
					text file or absolute paths and must be terminated either with a hyphen ("), with a newline character or with a &lt; character.<br/>
					The following examples show possible line formats:<br/>
					<code>
						d:\Images\test.jpg<br/>
						test.jpg<br/>
						"d:\My Documents\test.jpg"<br/>
						&lt;image&gt;d:\My Documents\test2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;<br/>
					</code>
					Note that the parser searches for a path marker (looking for :\ or \\) and ignores all text before the first found
					path marker. Starting from the path marker, the parser searches forward for an end marker (newline, " or &lt;) and
					everything after that end marker until end of line is also ignored.<br/>
					A slide show file list is a sort of virtual folder containing all images listed in the slide show file.
					<h4>Using Slide Shows</h4>
					The following commands can be used to control a slide show:
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>
							<kbd>PgDn/PgUp/Home/End</kbd> : Navigates to next/previous/first/last image of slide show
						</li>
						<li>
							<kbd>1 .. 9</kbd> : Starts the slide show with a delay of n seconds between the images
						</li>
						<li>
							<kbd>Ctrl + [Shift] + 1 .. 9</kbd> : Uses a delay of n/10 of a second, respectively n/100 of a second
						</li>
						<li>
							<kbd>Esc</kbd> : Stops the slide show
						</li>
					</ul>
					If the current context is a folder and not a slide show list, the slideshow is performed with the images
					in the folder. The folder navigation mode and the sorting order are taken into account in this case - with
					a slide show list they have no effect.
					<h4>Playing Image Series as Movie</h4>
					The slide show feature can be used to play a series of images in a folder or given by a text file as a movie:
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>
							First set the display order for the files. The order is either given by a text file or by choosing the
							<a href="#DisplayOrder">display order mode</a> for folders accordingly.
						</li>
						<li>
							Press the <kbd>Home</kbd> key to go to the first frame of the movie.
						</li>
						<li>
							Start the movie using the context menu 'Play folder as movie' or the <kbd>Ctrl+[Shift]+Number</kbd> keys.
							Of course the number of frames per seconds is limited by the computing power available to decode and process the frames.
							JPEGView will never skip frames - if more
							frames are requested than possible, the frames are displayed as fast as possible. During movie playing, high quality
							resampling, contrast correction and local brightness correction are disabled to speed up processing.
						</li>
						<li>Keeping parameters between the frames is enabled during movie playing - corrections apply to the whole movie.</li>
						<li>
							To stop the movie, press the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br/><br/><b>

					<a name="Processing"></a>
					<h3>Processing Images</h3>
					JPEGView provides some basic image processing. All image processing is done interactively on the fullscreen image what
					allows to see the effect of the processing immediately. The processed image can be stored either by storing the
					applied parameters in the parameter DB (the image remains untouched), by copying the processed image to the clipboard to
					further process it with an external program or by saving the processed image to a JPEG file.<br/>
					The following image processing commands are supported:
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>
							<b>Contrast</b><br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>Ctrl - +/-</kbd><br/>
							Mouse: Use processing panel<br/>
							Increases or decreases the global contrast of the image. Technically, the steepness
							of an S-curve is changed by this parameter.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Brightness</b><br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>Shift - +/-</kbd><br/>
							Mouse: Use processing panel<br/>
							Increases or decreases the global brightness of the image. Technically, a exponent of
							a gamma curve is changed by this parameter.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Saturation</b><br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>none</kbd><br/>
							Mouse: Use processing panel<br/>
							Increases or decreases the color saturation of the image.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Downsampling Sharpness</b><br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>Alt - +/-</kbd><br/>
							Mouse: Use processing panel. Note that this slider is only visible when the window/screen is large enough.<br/>
							Increases or decreases sharpness of the image. If the default sharpening filter is used, sharpness
							only applies to images that are downsampled but not for images displayed with 100% zoom. The
							filter to be used can be set in the INI file.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Unsharp Mask</b><br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>none</kbd><br/>
							Mouse: Use processing panel, 'Unsharp Mask' button.<br/>
							Unsharp masking is an adaptive sharpening filter that creates a smoothed version of the original image (thus the name 'unsharp').
							The filter then adds the difference of the original image and the smoothed image to the original image:<br/>
							Sharpened Image = Original Image + Amount * ( Original Image - Smoothed Image)<br/>
							The 'Radius' parameter sets the radius of the smoothing kernel, the 'Amount' parameter sets the amount of sharpening and the
							'Threshold' value sets the miminal difference of original and smoothed image to apply the filter to a pixel.<br/>
							Note that unsharp masking is previewed always in 100 % zoom.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Color balance</b><br/>
							Mouse: Use processing panel<br/>
							Changes the color balance of the image by changing the cyan-red, magenta-green and yellow-blue
							color balance.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Local brightness</b><br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>F6</kbd><br/>
							Mouse: Use processing panel<br/>
							Toggle local brightness correction. Local brightness correction lightens shadows and darkens
							highlights by applying a smoothed additive/subtractive mask to the image. It can be used to correct images with
							hard contrasts and uncovers details in dark shadows or in overexposed areas.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Color and contrast correction</b><br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>F5</kbd><br/>
							Mouse: Use processing panel<br/>
							Toggle color and contrast correction. Color correction tries to reduce global color casts. Contrast
							correction enhances contrast by moving the black point of the image (darkest area) towards black and the white point
							(brightest area) towards white. The color and contrast correction algorithm can be configured in the INI file.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Landscape picture enhancement mode</b><br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>Ctrl-L</kbd><br/>
							Mouse: Use navigation panel<br/>
							Toggle landscape picture enhancement mode. The landscape picture mode is simply a special parameter set optimized
							for landscapes pictures. It will brighten shadows, darken highlights and enhance contrast when needed. The parameter
							set used in landscape mode can be configured in the INI file (setting "LandscapeModeParams").
						</li>
					</ul>
					Most image processing can be done interactively with the mouse on the processing panel that appears when the mouse
					cursor is moved to the bottom of the screen.<br/>
					Default settings for most of the image processing parameters can be given in the <a href="#INIFile">INI file</a>.<br/>
					<h4>Keeping parameters between images</h4>
					By default, all image processing parameters (including zoom and pan) are reset to the default values given in the INI file
					when the next image is displayed. Using the <kbd>F4</kbd> key, the behavior can be changed to keeping the parameters between
					images. Pressing <kbd>F4</kbd> again will toggle back to not-keeping the parameters.<br/>
					<b>Note:</b> While keeping parameters mode is active, the parameter DB cannot be used. Parameter DB values are ignored while
					this mode is active.
					<h4>Comparing processed image with original image</h4>
					When JPEGView displays a new image, it creates a second set of image processing parameters and initializes it with zero,
					meaning that the original, unprocessed image will be displayed when this set is applied.
					<kbd>Ctrl-A</kbd> toggles between the two sets - allowing to compare the processed image with the original image.
					Note that it is possible to change both sets of parameters - however the second set will always be reset to zero when
					a new image is displayed.

					<a name="Saving"></a>
					<h3>Saving and renaming Images</h3>
					<h4>Saving images</h4>
					Processed images can be saved as JPEG, BMP, PNG or TIFF files using the 'Save image' (<kbd>Ctrl-S</kbd>) command.
					The image is saved in its original size: Performed rotations are taken into account, zoom and pan are not.
					To save an image in screen size, use the <kbd>Ctrl-Shift-S</kbd> keyboard shortcut.<br/>
					<b>Note:</b> The quality of the saved JPEG file can be set in the <a href="#INIFile">INI file</a>.<br/>
					JPEGView will automatically create a <a href="#ParameterDB">parameter DB</a> entry for the saved image having
					all image processing disabled.
					This prevents that JPEGView will double-apply automatic image improvements next time the image is displayed.<br/>
					<b>Note:</b> When saving images, JPEGView will prompt for a new file name. If you want that Ctrl-S just overrides the
					original file without showing a dialog, use the INI file setting OverrideOriginalFileWithoutSaveDialog=true.<br/>
					Use this setting with care, be aware of the risk!<br/>
				<b>EXIF information</b><br/>
					EXIF information is copied to the target JPEG image if it was present in the source JPEG image. An embedded thumbnail image
					is not touched - neither rotation nor image processing will be applied to the thumbnail image.<br/>

					<h4>Renaming images</h4>
					On the processing panel, images can be renamed by clicking on the file name with the mouse. To
					confirm the new name, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or click outside of the edit control. To cancel renaming, press <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
					Note that renaming images is not possible when a slide show file is loaded because this would invalidate the slide show file.

					<h4>Batch rename/copy</h4>
					Using the context menu entry 'Batch rename/copy' a series of files from the current folder can be renamed and/or copied to
					another folder:
					<ol start="1" type="1">
						<li>
							First select the files to be renamed. Use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> keys to select multiple files and click the checkboxes.
						</li>
						<li>
							Enter the target file name pattern. When not using a backslash in the pattern, the files are renamed in the current
							folder, else they are copied to the target folder as given. Target folders not yet existing are created as needed.<br/>
							Several placeholders are supported. See some examples below. A template pattern can be saved when needed.
						</li>
						<li>Before really renaming the files, always verify the new names by pressing the 'Preview' button.</li>
						<li>
							To rename the selected files, press the 'Rename' button. Renaming/copying can take a while, especially when
							the source or target is a slow USB device.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<b>Examples</b><br/><br/>
					<b>%pictures%\Digicam\%2y-%m-%M\%f</b><br/>
					Source image: IMG00244.JPG, created June 12, 2007<br/>
					Target: 'My pictures'\Digicam\07-06-June\IMG00244.JPG<br/>
					The folder 'Digicam\07-06-June\' is created when needed.<br/><br/>
					<b>%pictures%\Digicam\%M %y\Trip to Barcelona %x.%e</b><br/>

					<a name="Clipboard"></a>
					<h3>Copying Images to the Clipboard</h3>
					<b>Copy screen</b><br/>
					Keyboard: <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd><br/>
					Copies the image (respectively the visible image section) as displayed on the screen to the clipboard. This is similar to the
					<kbd>PrtSc</kbd> function, however text overlays and areas outside of the image are not included.<br/>
					<b>Copy processed image in its original size</b><br/>
					Keyboard: <kbd>Ctrl-X</kbd><br/>
					Copies the processed image in its original size to the clipboard. Rotation is taken into account, zoom and pan is not.
					This command is useful when the corrected image shall be processed and saved in an external application.
					<h3>Pasting Images from the Clipboard</h3>
					Keyboard: <kbd>Ctrl-V</kbd><br/>
					Paste image from clipboard and fit to screen.<br/>
					For pasted images, storing the parameters to the parameter DB is not possible
					because they have no representation on the file system. However these images can be processed and saved.
					<br/><br/><b>
						<a href="#Top">Top of Page</a>
					</b><br/>

					<a name="ParameterDB"></a>
					<h2>Parameter Database</h2>
					The currently visible section, rotation and the image processing parameters can be bound to the image by storing them to the
					parameter DB. If this image is displayed in JPEGView later on, the stored parameters will be loaded and applied automatically.
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>
							<b>Add image to the parameter DB</b><br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>S</kbd><br/>
							Mouse: Use processing panel
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Remove image from the parameter DB</b><br/>
							Keyboard: <kbd>D</kbd><br/>
							Mouse: Use processing panel
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Backup parameter DB</b><br/>
							Use this command in the context menu to backup the parameter DB to another folder or disk.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Restore parameter DB</b><br/>
							Use this command in the context menu to restore the parameter DB from a backuped version.
							Note that when restoring the parameter DB, the selected DB is merged with the current DB - so this
							command can also be used to merge two parameter DBs. In case of conflicting entries in the merge,
							the system asks which entries shall have priority.
						</li>
					</ul>
					Using the parameter DB has the advantage that the original image remains untouched. The parameter DB entry for an
					image is found using a hash value of the image file what has the following advantages:
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>Moving the image to a different folder or renaming the image does not break the link</li>
						<li>Two copies of the same image have the same parameter DB entry</li>
					</ul>
					For JPEG images, the hash value is created on the compressed pixel data but not on the EXIF and comment blocks. Changing
					the EXIF data or commenting the JPEG image will not invalidate the parameter DB entry.<br/>
					The following parameters are stored in the parameter DB:
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>
							Visible section of image<br/>
							The visible section is stored resolution independent - the same section will be displayed on a monitor with a higher
							resolution (but the zoom factor will be different then).
						</li>
						<li>Rotation of image</li>
						<li>Contrast value</li>
						<li>Brightness value</li>
						<li>Saturation value</li>
						<li>Sharpness value (but no Unsharp Mask)</li>
						<li>Color balance values</li>
						<li>Local brighness correction on/off</li>
						<li>Lighten shadows value</li>
						<li>Darken highlights value</li>
						<li>Deep shadows value</li>
						<li>Color and contrast correction on/off</li>
						<li>Color correction amount</li>
						<li>Contrast correction amount</li>
						<li>High quality resizing on/off</li>
					</ul>
					The parameter database is located in 'Documents and Settings\<i>Username</i>\Application Data\JPEGView\ParamDB.db',
					respectively in the EXE path when StoreToEXEPath=true is set in the INI file.
					It uses 40 bytes per stored parameter set and is limitated to 100000 entries.<br/>
					<b>Note:</b> The parameter DB settings have precedence over any image processing settings in the INI file.
					<br/><br/><b>
						<a href="#Top">Top of Page</a>
					</b><br/>

					<a name="INIFile"></a>
					<h2>JPEGView.ini file</h2>
					The INI file of JPEGView allows configuring a lot of parameters of the application. A two level hierarchy of INI files is
					used. If a setting is found in the user INI file, it has precedence over the same setting in the global INI file.
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>
							User INI file<br/>
							'Documents and Settings\<i>Username</i>\Application Data\JPEGView\JPEGView.ini'
						</li>
						<li>
							Global INI file<br/>
							'<i>Path of JPEGView.exe</i>\JPEGView.ini'
						</li>
					</ul>
					The global and user INI file can be edited by using the commands 'Edit global settings' and 'Edit user settings' in
					the context menu. Note that changes to these files do not take effect until JPEGView is restarted.<br/>
					Some parameters can be written to the user INI file with the command 'Save parameters to INI' located in the
					context menu.
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>Default contrast</li>
						<li>Default brightness</li>
						<li>Default saturation</li>
						<li>Default sharpness</li>
						<li>Default color balance</li>
						<li>Local brighness correction on/off by default</li>
						<li>Color and contrast correction on/off by default</li>
						<li>Default sorting order</li>
						<li>Default auto zoom mode</li>
						<li>Navigation panel on/off</li>
					</ul>
					The values set for the current image are written to the INI file when using this command. Be
					aware that these values are then used as default values for all images!<br/><br/>
					<b>Note:</b> No user INI file is used if the key StoreToEXEPath is set
					to true in the global INI file. All saved setting are directly written to the global INI file in this case.
					<h3>INI file settings</h3>
					The INI file settings are explained in detail in the <a href="./JPEGView.ini">INI file itself</a>.
					Only an overview on the available settings is given here:
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>Default image processing parameters: Contrast, brightness, sharpness, color balance</li>
						<li>Default background color</li>
						<li>Show file name by default</li>
						<li>Show file info by default</li>
						<li>Show navigation panel by default</li>
						<li>Blending factor for navigation panel</li>
						<li>Keep parameters by default</li>
						<li>Force CPU type (if autodetection fails)</li>
						<li>Force number of CPU cores to be used</li>
						<li>Used filter kernel for downsampling images</li>
						<li>Default sorting order</li>
						<li>Default navigation mode</li>
						<li>Default auto zoom mode</li>
						<li>Quality (and file size) of saved JPEG images</li>
						<li>Monitor to use (for multi monitor systems)</li>
						<li>Color and contrast correction settings</li>
						<li>Folders to explicitely include/exclude from auto color and contrast correction</li>
						<li>Local brighness correction settings</li>
						<li>Folders to explicitely include/exclude from local brightness correction</li>
						<li>Parameters used in landscape enhancement mode</li>
						<li>
							Definition of <a href="#External">user commands</a>
						</li>
					</ul><br/>

					A note on the support for multiple CPU cores (CPUCoresUsed setting):<br/>
					By default, JPEGView uses all cores of the CPU for processing images. To force JPEGView to use
					a given number of parallel processing threads, use the CPUCoresUsed setting.
					Note that no more than 4 cores (and therefore 4 processing threads) are supported.
					One additional thread is always created to read ahead the next image - this cannot be suppressed by the INI file.
					<br/><br/><b>
						<a href="#Top">Top of Page</a>
					</b><br/>

					<a name="External"></a>
					<h2>Calling external programs or batch files</h2>
					In the INI file, external commands can be defined and be bound to a key that is not used in JPEGView internally.
					The file name of the currently displayed image can be passed to the external command or program.<br/>
					Refer to the <a href="./JPEGView.ini">INI file itself</a> for a description of the format and the features.<br/>
					JPEGView itself uses this mechanism to implement the following commands:
					<ul style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in">
						<li>
							<kbd>Del</kbd> : Delete the current image file permanently - calls the command processor (cmd.exe) to
							delete the file.
						</li>
						<li>
							<kbd>R</kbd> : Rotate the current JPEG image lossless by +90 degrees - calls the jpegtran.exe program provided
							by the independent JPEG group
						</li>
						<li>
							<kbd>T</kbd> : Rotate the current JPEG image lossless by -90 degrees - calls the jpegtran.exe program
						</li>
					</ul>
					Other commands can be added as needed, e.g. starting your favorite image editor.

					<a name="Trouble"></a>
					<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
					<b>JPEGView crashes when displaying an image</b><br/>
					Maybe the CPU detection failed. Try to set the CPU type manually in the INI File (key 'CPUType'). Set this
					key to 'Generic' - this is slower but should run on all CPUs.<br/><br/>
					<b>
						The file type .JPG can not be assigned to JPEGView using the method described in the
						<a href="#Installation">installation section.</a> JPEGView never appears in the list of programs for JPG files even
						when it is added with 'Browse'.
					</b><br/>
					Maybe JPEGView was moved to another folder while the file type was already registered to it. In this case Windows
					loses the connection and this cannot be fixed with the Windows Explorer. Start regedit.exe and check the path in
					'HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\JPEGView.exe\shell\open\command'. Correct the path if it points to an invalid location.
