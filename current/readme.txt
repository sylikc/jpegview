JPEGView source code readme
***************************

To compile JPEGView you need:

- Visual Studio 2005 Express Edition with VC++ package (of course the standard or professional editions also work)
- Windows Platform SDK (platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 or later)
- Windows Template Library (WTL), Version 8.0 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/wtl/)
- To edit the resource file (rc) a free resource editor as www.radasm.com/resed/ is recommended

The include directories of the platform SDK and WTL must be added to the include directories for VC++:
Extras > Options > Projects and Solutions > VC++ directories > Include files


Debug version:
Before compiling the debug version for the first time, copy the five files included in this distribution
from JPEGView\Release
to JPEGView\Debug


Changelog
*********

[1.0.15]

Bugs removed:
- If using ClearType fonts, the button text on the image processing area is now rendered correctly
- EXIF information is now also found if not placed directly after SOI in JPEG image (e.g. after an APP0 block)
- File name flickering eliminated in image processing area when file name is long
New features:
- Display of EXIF information from digicam JPEG files (F2)
- Smoother screen update with less flickering by using back buffering of transparent areas
Other changes:
- Using smaller font for help display (F1)

[1.0.14]

Bugs removed:
- If a JPEG cannot be read with the IJL library, GDI+ is tried as a second chance
- Copy/rename dialog: Replacement text can now be longer than text input field (auto scroll enabled)
- Reader no longer crashes when stripe is negative for images read with GDI+
- Images with ending TIFF are no longer duplicated in file list
New features:
- File open... always uses tumbnail view (not only in 'my picture' directory)
- Saving files is now possible in the following formats: JPG, BMP, TIFF, PNG
- Copy/rename dialog: New placeholder %n for number from original file name
- Panning is faster and uses high quality resampling mode during pan
- New command to reload current image (Ctrl-R)
- Crop image section or zoom to image section with CTRL-Left mouse and dragging the mouse
- Paste image from clipboard (Ctrl-V)
Other changes:
- Color and contrast correction switched off in default INI file.
  It is recommended to switch it on for dedicated folders only, e.g. folders with digicam photos.
  Of course any user INI file remains untouched by this change.
- Due to an internal code simplification, all parameter DB entries for BMP images created with older versions 
  are lost with 1.0.14. Note that other formats (e.g. JPG) are not affected.

[1.0.13]

Bugs removed:
- Sorting by name now works correctly for names of the form X1 X1_y X2 X3
- When saving default values to INI file using the context menu, these default values are now immediately in effect for the next images
New features:
- File lists (text files) now support relative paths (relative to file list location)
- Movie mode enhanced and improved, now accessible using the context menu and automatically using fastest processing modes
- Batch rename/copy, allowing to copy and rename a series of files, e.g. from the digicam to the harddisk. Several placeholders are
  supported, e.g. file dates and consecutive numbers.
- Possibility to set the auto zoom mode, enabling to zoom images to fit the screen with or without border
Other changes:
- Keeping parameters between images (F4) will now override any values from the parameter DB while active.
  Note that while keeping parameters is on, storing to parameter DB is disabled.
- ICO removed from supported format list - GDI+ claims to be able to read it but can't
