# Installation

## Official Releases

Official releases will be made to [sylikc's GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sylikc/jpegview/releases) page.  Each release includes:

* **Archive Zip/7z** - Portable
* **Windows Installer MSI** - For Installs
* **Source code** - Build it yourself

## Portable

JPEGView _does not require installation_ to run.  Just **unzip, and run** either the 64-bit version, or the 32-bit version depending on which platform you're on.  It can save the settings to the extracted folder and run entirely portable.

## MSI Installer

For those who prefer to have JPEGView installed for All Users, a 32-bit/64-bit installer is available to download starting with v1.0.40.

(Unfortunately, I don't own a code signing certificate yet, so the MSI release is not signed.  Please verify checksums!)

### WinGet

If you're on Windows 11, or Windows 10 (build 1709 or later), you can also download it directly from the official [Microsoft WinGet tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) repository.  This downloads the latest MSI installer directly from GitHub for installation.

Example Usage:

C:\> `winget search jpegview`
```
Name     Id              Version  Source
-----------------------------------------
JPEGView sylikc.JPEGView 1.1.43  winget
```

C:\> `winget install jpegview`
```

### Scoop

[Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) is a Windows command-line installer and manager for portable applications.

To install with Scoop, run the following commands:

```shell
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install extras/jpegview-fork
```

After installation, the configuration file is located at `%HOMEPATH%\scoop\persist\JPEGView-fork\JPEGView.ini`.

## PortableApps

Another option is to use the official [JPEGView on PortableApps](https://portableapps.com/apps/graphics_pictures/jpegview_portable) package.  The PortableApps launcher preserves user settings in a separate directory from the extracted application directory.  This release is signed.

## System Requirements

* 64-bit version: Windows 7/8/10/11 64-bit or later
* 32-bit version: Windows 7 or later
  * A special _32-bit Windows XP SP2_ build is available, which supports most formats (except for formats added after v1.0.37.1, ex. Animated PNG, JXL, HEIC).  Other features and options are the same as the normal builds.

## What's New

* See what has changed in the [latest releases](https://github.com/sylikc/jpegview/releases)
* Or Check the [CHANGELOG.txt](https://github.com/sylikc/jpegview/blob/master/CHANGELOG.txt) to review new features in detail.

# Help / Documentation

The JPEGView documentation is a little out of the date at the moment, but should still give a good summary of the features.

This [readme.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sylikc/jpegview/blob/master/src/JPEGView/Config/readme.html) is part of the JPEGView package.

# Brief History

This GitHub repo continues the legacy (is a "fork") of the excellent project [JPEGView by David Kleiner](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jpegview/).  Unfortunately, starting in 2020, the SourceForge project has essentially been abandoned, with the last update being [2018-02-24 (1.0.37)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jpegview/files/jpegview/).  It's an excellent lightweight image viewer that I use almost daily!

The starting point for this repo was a direct clone from SourceForge SVN to GitHub Git.  By continuing this way, it retains all previous commits and all original author comments.

I'm hoping with this project, some devs might help me keep the project alive!  It's been awhile, and could use some new features or updates.  Looking forward to the community making suggestions, and devs will help with some do pull requests as some of the image code is quite a learning curve for me to pick it up. -sylikc

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to [qbnu](https://github.com/qbnu) for adding additional codec support!
* Animated WebP
* Animated PNG
* JPEG XL with animation support
* HEIF/HEIC/AVIF support

Thanks to all the translators which keep JPEGView strings up-to-date in different languages!  See [CHANGELOG.txt](https://github.com/sylikc/jpegview/blob/master/CHANGELOG.txt) to find credits for translators at each release!
