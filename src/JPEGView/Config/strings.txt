The following file extensions cannot be unregistered because they have been registered in the 'local machine' registry area.	
The following image extensions are protected by the operating system.	
The imported param DB contains entries already present in active param DB.	
The new size is too large - width or height is larger than 65535 or total number of pixels is too large!	
The old parameter DB file '%s' could not be renamed during conversion to new format!	
The operation failed because not enough memory is available!	
The parameter DB file '%s' has been created by a newer version of JPEGView!	
The transformation can be applied if the image is cropped to the next matching size but this will remove some border pixels.	
These values will override the values from the INI file located in the program folder of JPEGView!
